# You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.
# To work out the love score between two people:
#
# 1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#
# 2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#
# 3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.
